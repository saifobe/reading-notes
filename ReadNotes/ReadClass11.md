# Jupyter Lab
- Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.
- Jupyter Lab is a great tool for data scientists, researchers, and students who want to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.

# Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
- Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

# Numpy
- NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
- It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
- NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

# Pandas
- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
- It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
- The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.
- Pandas allow us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
- Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
- Relevant data is very important in data science.

# Matplotlib
- Matplotlib is a low level graph plotting library in python that serves as a visualization utility.
- Matplotlib was created by John D. Hunter.
- Matplotlib is open source and we can use it freely.
- Matplotlib is mostly written in python, a few segments are written in C, Objective-C and Javascript for Platform compatibility.
- Matplotlib.org is the official website of Matplotlib library.
- Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.
