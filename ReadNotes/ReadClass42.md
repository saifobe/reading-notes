# Code of Ethics

## GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
computer scientists and software engineers, in the performance of their professional duties, shall adhere to the following Principles of Professional Conduct:
- 1.1. Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
- 1.2. Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.
- 1.3. Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
- 1.4. Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
- 1.5. Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
- 1.6. Perform work only in areas of competence.
- 1.7. Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
- 1.8. Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
- 1.9. Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.
- 1.10. Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.

### 2. Avoid harm.
"harm" means negative consequences, especially when those consequences are significant and unjust. Examples of harm include unjustified physical or mental injury, unjustified destruction or disclosure of information, and unjustified damage to property, reputation, and the environment. This list is not exhaustive.

### 3. Be honest and trustworthy.
Honesty is an essential component of trustworthiness. A computing professional should be transparent and provide full disclosure of all pertinent system capabilities, limitations, and potential problems to the appropriate parties. Making deliberately false or misleading claims, fabricating or falsifying data, offering or accepting bribes, and other dishonest conduct are violations of the Code.

### 4. Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
Computing professionals should foster fair participation of all people, including those of underrepresented groups. Prejudicial discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, ethnicity, family status, gender identity, labor union membership, military status, nationality, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, or any other inappropriate factor is an explicit violation of the Code. Harassment, including sexual harassment, bullying, and other abuses of power and authority, is a form of discrimination that, amongst other harms, limits fair access to the virtual and physical spaces where such harassment takes place.

### 5. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
computing professionals should not claim as their own creation, ideas, inventions, creative works, or computing artifacts of others. They should credit others for their work and contributions, respect intellectual property rights, and give appropriate acknowledgements.

### 6. Respect privacy.
The responsibility of respecting privacy applies to computing professionals in a particularly profound way. Technology enables the collection, monitoring, and exchange of personal information quickly, inexpensively, and often without the knowledge of the people affected. Therefore, it is especially important for computer professionals to respect the privacy of individuals and organizations. This includes respecting the privacy of those who use social media, and those who are the subjects of data collection. Computing professionals should only access information when authorized or when compelled by the public good. Policies and procedures for data management and documentation should be clearly communicated and properly implemented.

### 7. Honor confidentiality.
Confidentiality is a cornerstone of privacy protection. Computing professionals should protect confidentiality unless required to do otherwise by a bona fide legal authority or with the consent of the appropriate parties.

## Ethics in Technology

### 1. The Principle of Informed Consent
The principle of informed consent applies to collection of personal data for use in machine learning. Informed consent requires that the data subject be informed of the nature, purpose, and duration of the data processing activity, as well as the identity of the data controller and the data controllerâ€™s representative, if any. The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. The data subject should be informed of the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

### 2. The Principle of Procedural Justice
The principle of procedural justice requires that the data subject be informed of the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

### 3. The Principle of Fairness
The principle of fairness requires that the data subject be informed of the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

### 4. The Principle of Beneficence
The principle of beneficence requires that the data subject be informed of the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

### 5. The Principle of Non-Maleficence
The principle of non-maleficence requires that the data subject be informed of the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

### 6. The Principle of Autonomy
The principle of autonomy requires that the data subject be informed of the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, and meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

### 7. The Principle of Justice

The data subject should also be informed of the existence of his or her rights, including the right to withdraw consent at any time, the right to access data, and the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority.

### 8. The Principle of Explicability
