## What is Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where developers write automated tests before writing the code. It involves writing a test, seeing it fail, writing the minimum code to pass the test, refactoring the code, and repeating the process. TDD contributes to overall code quality by ensuring comprehensive testing, encouraging modular and maintainable code, and reducing development time and cost.

## Explain the purpose of the if name == 'main': statement in Python scripts?

The if __name__ == '__main__' statement in Python is used to check if the current script is being executed as the main program or being imported as a module into another program. Including this conditional in your code can help you write executable code that is only executed when the script is run directly and not when it is imported as a module. It is commonly used for writing tests, running command-line interfaces, and building standalone applications.


## Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

 Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case


## What is the difference between Python modules and packages?

In Python, a module is a single file containing Python code, while a package is a collection of related modules organized in a directory hierarchy. A module is identified by a single file with a .py extension and can be imported and used in other programs. A package is identified by a directory that contains an "init.py" file and can contain multiple related modules.
