# What is Data Structure?
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures. 

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

One important consideration when choosing a data structure to solve a problem is the time complexity of the operations that will be performed on the data.

Different data structures have different strengths and weaknesses in terms of their time complexity for various operations. For example, an array is great for random access and searching but not very efficient for inserting or deleting elements, while a linked list is efficient for inserting and deleting elements but less efficient for random access and searching.

By analyzing the operations that will be performed on the data and their frequency, you can determine which data structure is best suited for the problem. It's important to choose a data structure that provides the necessary functionality while also being efficient in terms of time complexity for the operations that will be performed most frequently.
