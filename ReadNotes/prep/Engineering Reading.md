# How to think like a programmer ? 

To think like a programmer, you need to approach problems in a systematic and logical way. First, you should break down the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. This will help you understand the problem better and make it easier to solve.

Next, you need to define the problem clearly. Make sure you understand what is being asked of you and what the expected output should be. Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you can start planning your solution.

It's important to plan your solution before writing any code. Think about the steps you'll need to take to solve the problem and the logic you'll need to use. Writing out your solution in pseudocode can be helpful in this stage.

As you write your code, test it frequently and debug any issues that arise. Refactor your code as needed to make it more efficient and easier to read.

Remember that making mistakes is a normal part of programming. Learn from your mistakes and use what you've learned to improve your skills. Finally, keep learning and stay up to date with the latest technologies and techniques in the field.

By approaching problems in a logical and systematic way, planning your solution, testing and debugging your code, and continuously learning, you can start to think like a programmer and become a more effective problem solver.

# How to Solve Programming Problems ?

1- Read the problem completely twice.
2- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3-Optimize the manual steps.
4-Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6- Optimize the real code.

### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

Hard work and fast Learning

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1- Take a break: Sometimes, taking a break and stepping away from the problem can help you come back to it with fresh eyes.

2-Break it down: Break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

3-Seek help: Don't be afraid to ask for help. Reach out to a colleague, mentor, or an online community for assistance
