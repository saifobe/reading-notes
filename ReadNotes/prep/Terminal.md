# The Command Line

## What is The Command Line ?
The command line, also known as the terminal or shell, is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. Rather than using a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and menus, the user enters commands into a text prompt to perform tasks and manage files and directories.

On most operating systems, the command line is accessed through a program called a terminal emulator, which provides a window where the user can enter commands. Commands are typically composed of a command name, followed by arguments or options that modify the command's behavior.

Using the command line can be more efficient than using a GUI for certain tasks, especially those that involve repetitive or batch operations. It is also a powerful tool for system administrators and developers who need to automate tasks, write scripts, and perform advanced operations.

## how does it work and how do I get to one ?
The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
