# Pandas 
- Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
- It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
- The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.
- Pandas allow us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
- Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
- Relevant data is very important in data science.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

# Pandas Series
- A Pandas Series is like a column in a table.
- It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.
- Create a simple Pandas Series from a list:

```python
import pandas as pd

a = [1, 7, 2]

myvar = pd.Series(a)

print(myvar)
```
