## Explain the concept of variable scope in Python and describe the difference between local and global scope. Provide an example illustrating the usage of both.

* Variable scope is the part of the program where a variable is visible and accessible.
* Local scope is the part of the program where a variable is visible and accessible.
* Global scope is the part of the program where a variable is visible and accessible.

## How do the global and nonlocal keywords work in Python, and in what situations might you use them?

* The global keyword is used to define a variable inside a function as a global variable.
* The nonlocal keyword is used to define a variable inside a nested function (function inside a function) as a non-local variable.

## What is the purpose and importance of Big O notation in the context of algorithm analysis?

* Big O notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

## Describe how you would use code to calculate the probability of rolling a specific number (e.g., the probability of rolling a 6) over a large number of trials?

* The probability of rolling a specific number is the number of times that number appears divided by the total number of rolls.
