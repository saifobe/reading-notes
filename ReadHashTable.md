# Hash Tables
## What is a Hash Table?
A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

## Why use them?
Hash tables are used because they are very efficient at finding data. They are also very efficient at adding data. They are also very efficient at deleting data. They are also very efficient at updating data.

## What are the different types?
There are many different types of hash tables. The most common is the dictionary. A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A keyâ€™s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact, you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.

## What are some of the things that make them different?
Hash tables are different from other data structures because they use a hash function to store and retrieve data. A hash function is a function that takes a piece of data and returns a number. The hash function is used to determine where the data should be stored in the hash table. The hash function is also used to determine where the data should be retrieved from the hash table.

## What are some of the things that make them similar?
Hash tables are similar to other data structures because they are used to store and retrieve data.

## When should you use a hash table?
Hash tables are used when you need to store and retrieve data.

## What can you store in them?
Hash tables can store any type of data.

## What is a hash function?
Hash functions are functions that take a piece of data and return a number.

## What makes a good hash function?
A good hash function is one that returns a number that is unique for each piece of data.

## What is a hash collision?
A hash collision is when two pieces of data have the same hash value.

## What happens when a hash collision occurs?
When a hash collision occurs, the data is stored in a linked list.
